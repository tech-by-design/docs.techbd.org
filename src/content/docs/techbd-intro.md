The New York eHealth Collaborative (NYeC) is at the forefront of shaping the
digital health landscape in New York. As a governance body, NYeC plays a pivotal
role in providing strategic direction to Qualified Entities (QEs), leveraging
industry-standard specifications such as HL7 FHIR and IHE. NYeC's approach
emphasizes descriptive (rather than prescriptive) guidance to empower QEs in
their mission to enhance healthcare data sharing across the state.

## NYeC's Role

- Governance and Direction: NYeC sets the standards and best practices that
  guide the health information exchange (HIE) ecosystem.
- Industry Standards: Adopts recognized industry specifications like HL7 FHIR
  and IHE to ensure interoperability and predictable data exchange.
- Descriptive Approach: Provides flexible guidelines, enabling QEs to adapt
  based on their specific needs and capabilities.

## Qualified Entities' Role

- Data Exchange: As key stakeholders in the HIE network, QEs are responsible for
  acquiring and sharing healthcare data from various network participants.
- Compliance: Ensure adherence to the governance specifications set forth by
  NYeC, fostering a unified healthcare data infrastructure.

## TechBD's Role

- Collaboration Facilitation: TechBD serves as a facilitator for QEs to
  collaborate effectively, focusing on consensus-based decision-making that
  aligns with NYeC's governance.
- Shared Solutions: Encourages QEs to share code for custom software and
  collaborate on services that benefit the entire network.
- Infrastructure Sharing: Assists QEs in identifying opportunities to leverage
  shared cloud infrastructure like AWS for optimized resource utilization.

Through this strategy, NYeC ensures that the state's health information exchange
continues to evolve in a unified, interoperable, and efficient manner. The
collaborative efforts facilitated by TechBD will empower QEs to meet governance
requirements while innovating in ways that strengthen the healthcare system.
