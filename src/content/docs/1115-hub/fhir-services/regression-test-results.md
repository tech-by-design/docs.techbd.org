### TechBD FHIR API test scripts and results

Learn about API endpoints by reviewing [TechBD's FHIR API Test Script](/docs.techbd.org/assurance/1115-waiver/ahc-hrsn/screening/regression-test-prime/fhir-service-prime/results/latest/src/fhir-service.test.http).

#### Postman-based API test scripts

For developers who prefer to use Postman for API testing and debugging, instead of TechBD's [httpYac](https://httpyac.github.io/)-based strategy, you can easily convert [`fhir-service.test.http`](/docs.techbd.org/assurance/1115-waiver/ahc-hrsn/screening/regression-test-prime/fhir-service-prime/results/latest/src/fhir-service.test.http) httpYac file to Postman:

- Open the `fhir-service.test.http` and familiarize yourself with the structure of the file. You will see sections defining HTTP requests, including HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), URLs, headers, and body content.
- Open Postman and create a new collection.
- Add a new request to the collection for each HTTP request defined in the `fhir-service.test.http` file:
  - Copy the method (GET, POST, etc.) from the httpYac file and set it in Postman.
  - Copy the URL from the httpYac file and paste it into the Postman request URL field.
  - Set the request headers in Postman by copying the headers from the httpYac file. Ensure each header key and value is correctly set.
  - If the request includes a body, copy the body content from the httpYac file and paste it into the Postman body section. Select the appropriate body type (e.g., raw, JSON, form-data).
  - Be sure to replace variables as necessary
